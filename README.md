# CookingRecipes-CCAPDEV

As of submission, this project relies on an in-memory MongoDB database, so restarting the server will
wipe off any changes made to the server.

The startup scripts are in place to make running easier. To run the server:

1. Run `npm install` to download the required dependencies
2. Start the server by running `npm start`. Should modifications be made while editing, type `npm run devstart`.
   Take note that for every change, the server restarts, removing all changes.

DISCLAIMER: Not all functionality is implemented at this stage.
