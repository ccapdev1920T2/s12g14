Malunggay and corn soup isn't a new idea. It's actually one of the simplest ways of making soup! It's basically just four ingredients: malunggay, corn, an onion, and chicken broth. A little oil gently heats up the ingredients, and salt and pepper to boost the overall flavors are all that's needed to make this flavorful and hearty soup. It's a simple dish, so why not add a little something to make it even more delicious? Make it a mashup of the egg drop soup and the malunggay and corn soup to make it more appetizing. Plus, we ditch the popular yellow corn for some sweet purple and white corn instead. Also known as Batik or Violeta, this dual-colored white corn variety is much like the waxy white corn ears but tastes sweeter and is more nutritious overall than the yellow corn. You will more easily find these purple and white corn ears around the country in supermarkets (we found ours in Robinsons Supermarket!) and palengkes. ",
